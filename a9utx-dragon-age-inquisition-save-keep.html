It’s May and that means the annual Morrowind Modathon is back to celebrate the 17th anniversary of The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind - and this time around there are not only achievements waiting to be unlocked but also a huge number of keys for AAA and indie games I've never imported my saves to DAI because DAO and DA2 I have on 360 while I have DAI on my XBONE. My internet is awful so I never connect my ONE to the internet because it always tries to update and it's almost literally impossible for me to do because I live in nowhere Oklahoma and there's no reasonable internet options. If I bought DAI for the 360 would I be able to import it all seamlessly Mass Effect style it would I still Dragon Age: Inquisition Race Lockscreens. Sadly i can’t find them with so much quality, i tried to fix it but i think it wasn’t enough, so…sorry about that, i will try to make them better.  Although the Frostbite engine, the game engine upon which Dragon Age: Inquisition is built, is notoriously hard to mod, modders have figured out how to change some things, bringing a new level of customization to the game. To add mods to Dragon Age: Inquisition, all you need is the DA-I Mod Manager. I just finished my playthroughs of DAO and DA2, and now I want to start Inquisition, but I don't want to go though and select everything in the tapestry (mostly because I don't remember a lot of it). Is it possible to import my save from DA2 into keep so that my decisions are loaded automatically. 
In the fall of 2014, BioWare released Dragon Age: Inquisition, the studio’s first modern open-world game and the first role-playing game to be made on EA’s Frostbite engine.It was a critical. I have my origins connected to my PSN tag. Can't find where to transfer What Pride Had Wrought is a main quest in Dragon Age: Inquisition. The Inquisition's efforts have weakened Corypheus's attempts to stir unrest in Thedas. Now is the ideal time to strike. Something has happened and the default world state my game pulled from is not the world state I saved. Is there any way to edit the worldstate in dragon age keep and reexport it mid Inquisition, or do I need to start over to get my save state? I'm saddened about this but I'll start a new game if I must. Thanks. This is part of Dragon Age: Inquisition’s post-game commentary from several of your companions and advisors.It was a nice touch to wrap-up the major conflict with some humorous comments sprinkled throughout. Because I just really don't like Origins all that much to be honest, and I will say it is 100% the slow combat, I don't like it and it's not very immersive to me. I'd much prefer to just skip to DA2 but I don't want to miss any story in Origins. I'm playing Hey guys, I was having some trouble a couple days ago with In Your Heart You Shall Burn not loading Skyhold, so I uninstalled and reinstalled it. Now every time it tries to auto-save it freezes completely. I can't go anywhere because I can't take off Auto-Save! Heeeeeelppppp meeeee.

Basically title. This is Biowares 3rd game since switching over to the frostbite engine and their games keep getting worse. It's obvious the engine is not equipped to handle anything more than the FPS games it was designed for, even for the flagship sports games it's pretty dicey. Letting your developers use the engines that will work best for their games will literally pay for themselves hand over fist when your developers put out higher quality less broken games. Don't get me wrong though. I am replaying the Dragon Age series for the first time in many years. I haven't replayed Origins since 2010, DA2 since 2011, and I played Inquisition but didn't finish it in 2014. So I hope to rectify that this time around. Side note, holy crap is it hard to get Origins to run stably on a modern PC--even without mods. I was experiencing crashes regularly, and the inability to load saves without crashing. I had to patch the exe to 4gb to even play the game vanilla. I still love Origins I just completed my second playthrough of Inquisition and had so much fun, I wrote it down with lots of headcanon and thought I'd share it with you. I played as a female Dalish mage named Danae Lavellan. It's a long-ish read and super elfy but I hope you enjoy! Danae Lavellan was born in 8412 FA (9:13 Dragon) to the Tillahnnen clan as they passed through the Free Marches on their way to Antiva. The Tillahnnens recognized her magical potential early when inexplicable things began happening.

Game of Thrones Open World Video Game Ideas Warning: Possible SPOILERS. Also.very long post ahead! I’m talking article length! But this is very important, so I need all of you to stop what you're doing and listen! Cannonballlllllllll in to this post! (Or at least save it for later and come back to share your thoughts if you have time, lol) \ \ \ Quick Note\ \ \ \~ First off I know not everyone likes an open-world format in video games. I completely understand What happens to Dragon Age in the (hopefully far away) future, when the servers go offline? For DA Origins on the 360, if I can't sign in, then I'm not able to load a file with DLC on it. So in the future we can only play the original game without the add ons? Also DA Inquisition, and the DA Keep? I imagine the DA Keep will be alive as long as DA itself, but with Anthem being a mess (EDIT- Actually I've been informed that Anthem sold well) and Bioware not being in the greatest of standings I would love to say a few things before you read my opinion on the game. I am a veteran of Division, Destiny and WoW. I have played many games, but if I am to list an online RPG or MMORPG, which has an endgame and grows, it would be these three. Also the text isn’t supposed to say the game isn’t fun. It can be. I am just afraid for it in certain ways. And I do understand the game is new and it’s gonna grow. I am just pointing out stuff that bothered me at the moment.I would Let me begin by saying: i loved the souls series, i've played a lot of both 1 and 2, while i have almost a thousand of hours on DS3. I'm also an hardcore fan of Monster Hunter, and while i do have MHW and i play it regularly, i need something to break a bit from it to not burn out. I'll also give some guidelines. What i like / i'm looking for (in no particular order): I like Action RPGs a lot. Turn Based RPG are welcome too, but they have to be interesting in their mechanics. 
Right so I've finished Dragon age Origins and Dragon age II on Xbox one and want to export them to dragon age keep so I can use it for Inquisition. But, while my Dragon age II save is uploaded to the keep and my Origins save worked for my Dragon age II playthrough on Dragon age keep only my II and Inquisition saves come up and on the actual game Origins it keeps saying it can't connect to the servers. Does anyone know what to do is it a common problem? If so what should. FranceInfo interviewed Tony Valente, the author of Radiant, in May last year. (https://blog.francetvinfo.fr/popup/2018/05/24/ca-serait-fantastique-de-pouvoir-faire-une-quarantaine-de-tomes-entretien-avec-tony-valente-lauteur-du-manga-radiant.html?fbclid=IwAR0tWfXlarfAJwdxW3kHsp3vCcLcIzB9PybJ45UuquYw1Zz1lEYpya8FOiY) It is the most exhaustive interview of him that I have come across to this date. It's very interesting and covers a wide range of topics; how Tony grew up, what his inspirations. This has been something that has bothered me for a while and has only become worse in recent months. I hold no special animosity towards any who disagree, nor am I here to change minds. But I feel if I don't lay this out now it is going to seriously affect my creative work as this just seems to keep bugging me whenever I write about Mass Effect. And that's the simple fact that I feel BioWare has done the Quarians wrong. I don't mean to suggest that BioWare hates the Quarians Hello all! I have played WoW since BC and stopped playing die hard back in MoP and I have become more of a casual. With the introduction of Classic around the corner I got to thinking that I would like to play the retail game a little more casually and maybe if I can find a set up suitable enough I would like to play this way on classic at least to level up. So I am curious if someone can point me to the right mods for the following. I would like to be able to utilize the Xbox One Elite control. Hello there! (Foreward) I bought the inquisition bundle in the Xbox store during the Christmas sale for dirt cheap. Love mass effect, dark souls, skyrim, etc. I knew of this series, heard it was great but never got around to playing any of the games. Til now. I just pummeled Corypheus into the ground and celebrated with my friends at Skyhold! Gotta say, I put off playing this game for WAY too long. Fantastic adventure.
