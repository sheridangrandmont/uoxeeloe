Было бы не плохо, если бы автор статьи указал, как запустить видео расширение MPEG в Google Chrome. Расширение bin - это образ диска cd или dvd, хранит двоичные данные, скопированные с компакт-диска или dvd. Файл bin может быть установлен на компьютере и распознается в качестве физического диска. I noticed today that it seems like in El Capitan both MPlayerX and MPlayer OS X Extended have completely broken: video loads, but for some reason is incredibly interlaced, pixelated, and jaggy. This was never an issue in Yosemite and was wondering if anyone else noticed this issue and has a solution.

Hello people, amp#x200B; Am using Opensuse as my main OS for like a couple of weeks now. I really love it but I just stumbled upon an issue and my web research did not provide the solution. After the last big update I don't have any video except youtube able to play : I get a codec error on VLC, and errors too on chromium and firefox, and mplayer just play the sound with a black screen. amp#x200B; I checked if I have the right codecs installed : everything x264 and x265 needed are instal. Утилита для создания идентичных копий dvd и позволяющая умещать созданную копию на одной или нескольких болванках. This happened a while ago but USB Loader GX just randomly stopped working on my Wii. It works fine on another hacked Wii but crashes back to the HBC on mine when I try to start a game. Whatever happened also prevents me from using multi mod manager’s WAD utility and Project M. Is there a way to fix it? Edit: Just looked at MMM iOS list and found that 3, 202, and 236 don’t have a version installed. 202 is occupied by Kwiirk’s for MPlayer CE. 222 and 223 have Hermes. 236 just says custom Бесплатный браузер, основанный на движке Chromium от команды разработчиков оригинальной Оперы и лично от Йона фон Течнера, бывшего гендиректора и сооснователь Opera Software. 
This distro, INX, is based on Ubuntu 8.04 "Hardy Heron" and was last updated in 2009. But it's an absolutely fantastic OS. It uses the command line entirely. No X. Yet it manages through a beautiful selection of applications to amaze the hell out of me. It can play video and music directly from the console with Mplayer, it has a version of the Links2 browser that somehow is graphical (I imagine it uses a bit of X-window code) without requiring the full X-Window-System or desktop environment. I've been having some problems when it comes to either using the phone's Camera app to record videos or when I use the built-in screen recorder function. All of my Android friends see the videos OK but my iPhone friends don't see it. They see the bottom part as completely green. We tested it out and if an iPhone user sents videos I can see them just fine. We've been using Telegram to send the files but it doesn't seem to matter whether I choose to send the files without additional compre.

Hi I have a Listen Q1Plus controller card that receives video signals for LED Modules from 1000M Ethernet. On the PC I can use the LED MPlayer software to make this happen but it seems a tad hacky and I would love to use a Mac in OS X. Something that works with Syphon would be a dream. Does anyone have any clues how I may do this? Or do I just need to use an external video processor. 
I’ve searched all over for solution to this, with no luck, so I thought I’d reach out here. I’m not very technically inclined. I’m running Mac OS 10.10.3, using Anki 2.1.1, and I’m trying to add audio files to my cards. When I do so, this prompt comes up: ‘Sound and video on cards will not function until mpv or mplayer is installed’. I’ve downloaded amp attempted to run every version of these two programs that I could find, but they all fail to open (‘mpv/mplayer quit unexpectedly.’). Hi there -- I am a Unity dev. I, like many others, including my teammates and other indie devs I've spoken to, are simply waiting for a "real" stable release  1 mil received 2016, .6 bil received in 2016 (https://venturebeat.com/2017/05/25/why-unity-was-able-to-raise-400-million-at-a-2-6-billion-valuation/), yet major bugs have existed for several major versions, there are only 2 people working on UNET, and both leftover and newly-introduced bugs are destroying your Unity developers. Well I spend my last two days trying to install app-misc/anki and probably spend hours of useless recompiling trying to understand why emerge installs openssl-1.1.0g and fails when either compiling any version of python. How can I resolve this? This interferes with mostly all of my emerge requests because it wishes to install openssl-1.1.0g first and python second and fails. Here is the file structure ( find  -exec zsh -c 'echo "{}";cat {}' \;) of /etc/portage/package.use/ /vim_latex. Every once in a while a post pops up, often from a new Mac user, looking for the best Mac apps to download. I’ve compiled a list here in case it’s useful to anyone. Note: I’ve deliberately tried to avoid apps that are industry-specific in an attempt to focus on the apps that are most relevant to a general audience, so you’ll notice a handful of popular web/graphic design apps (Coda, Transmit, etc.) aren’t listed here. Let me know if there’s anything else that should be included. ampnbsp;. Hello, I noticed you are a proponent of the x220 (u/cobaltcolander ?), and I found this local place that is selling one used (obviously)--this particular place is also offering a 4th gen i5 t440p for 5 and w520 for 5 (I've forgotten the condition grades). Do you think this will be good for someone who is 1) interested in eventually running Qubes OS, 2) Survive 5-10 years, replacing battery perhaps and other components that need superseding, while remaining up to date security-wise. So I've installed lubuntu on an RCA craptop I got a year ago, because I cannot stand Win10 another second. The install process was made difficult by the fact that it's one of those Bay Trail devices, which has a 32-bit UEFI and a 64 bit processor and OS. Difficult, but not impossible, thanks to this ( script, which modified a standard lubuntu iso. Most things seem to work fairly well, the OS works 
For anyone wondering I did get this working in smplayer with the mplayer backend by adding the below command to Options gt Preferences gt Advanced gt Options. ampnbsp; -af pan=2:0.25:0:0:0.25:0.25:0:0:0.25:0.125:0.125:0.5:0.5 ampnbsp; Does anyone know how to include the lfe channel in stereo playback when using mpv? ampnbsp; I have already created an mpv config file at ~/.config/mpv "mpv.conf" and added some basic video settings; ampnbsp; profile=gpu-hq scale=ewa_lanczossh. Hi, I just wanted to point out (my) biggest issues about desktop usage of openbsd 6.2 after two months steep learning curve while never having used any BSD or even Linux OS before. I know some of the problems are not because "openbsd is bad". more like because "it's so good". 1. Video Playback is choppy with (s)mplayer as well as with firefox. I have integrated intel graphics (and secondary nvidia card, disabled by bios). Seems like there is openGL 1.4 degradation with i915 drivers or intel. Hi! I'm using the 0.3.10 version of popcorn time and I can't connect it to my Chromecast. I have a mac with MacOS High Sierra and it doesn't appear the option. I changed the chromecast name, reinstalled Popcorn time, turned off/on the wifi and nothing works, I only have the Butter, VLC and mplayer options. Apple OSes are extremely finicky about how their HEVC files are encoded, I am having a lot of trouble finding out exactly how to encode my files to work with iOS, macOS, and tvOS. When I encode something with FFMPEG, I get something that looks like this" Container Format: MPEG-4 Format profile: Base Media Codec ID: isom (isom/iso2/mp41) Duration: 1 h 40 min 50 s 128 ms Overall bit rate: 669 kb/s Encoded date: UTC 2017-09-19 15:14:32 Tagged date: UTC 2017-09-19. Hey all, I've been needing to get a new laptop now for probably about a year, but the funds just weren't there. The one I have functions, an early 2011 13.3" Macbook Pro, but I stopped updating at 10.7.5, and I recently asked a guy at Best Buy about simply updating to help my computer, and he says they still sell a similar model to my mac, and they get a lot of complaints and returns from people that update to current. The old hardware just doesn't mix well with new software (I acknowledge 
I just took the plunge into blogging, and my first piece of writing turned into a (5000-word) rewrite of tricks / apps I've collected through the years on how to work more efficiently with OS X. Thought some people here could make use of it. The site is brand-new, this is a self-post so no karma, and there is no advertising so hopefully it won't be seen as linkbait. Also my first stab at writing longer, so if you have any comments on writing style, I'd be more than happy to listen!

A web stream would be nice but the main end goal is to get the video feed to display via the HDMI connection but I'm having trouble getting a decent feed to work. Via mplayer, I get good frame rates but the color/gamma/contrast are all messed up. Via VLC, the color is good, but the video feed is super low frame rates (think -5 fps).
