About Native Instruments: Native Instruments’ first product, Generator, a virtual modular synth that eventually morphed into Reaktor, may have been born of Berlin's active techno scene, but the success of that product and Pro-5, a model of the legendary Sequential Circuits Pro-Five synth, led company founder Stephan Schmitt to realize that they could easily expand beyond just the electronica.

Hi all. Just downloaded Sessions Strings Pro 2. I want to use it as a plugin while creating some tracks in Garageband, but it says I have to add them to Native Access and Kontakt Player first. I downloaded both (Kontakt 6) but can't figure out how to proceed. Native Access requires a serial number (which I obviously don't have), and when I try to manually drag the .nki files to Kontakt, it pops up with "this instrument belongs to a library that is currently not installed." amp#x200B; https://darkcherry.net/native-instruments-kontakt-5-v5-6-0-max-os-x-2019/. I've been using stock plugins for a long time, and I've been hearing from friends "why don't you get plugins from Native Instruments?" I've been looking at all of the plugins they offer and It seems like there's some kind of hierarchy or Integration-tree that I'm not following at all. Between Kontact kit, Maschine, and all the other items. Can anyone break down how the different programs work together, or are they all separate but can be used together.? Any help is much appreciated. Hi everyone, I used to use FL many many years ago and want to get back into this as a hobby and then potential some side work. I'm particularly interested in composing and producing big orchestra music and want to get started on this with FL since I'm somewhat familiar with it (but would still consider myself a complete newbie). Can you please recommend which version/plugins/samples or other things I may need to do this on a hobbyist level. I can spend around 0ish. Thanks I am looking to get into using instruments beyond the stock ones in Logic Pro X and have been researching Komplete and Kontakt (the free versions for now) amp#x200B; Does anyone use either or both of these and can give me a quick and dirty on the differences? amp#x200B; Thank.
