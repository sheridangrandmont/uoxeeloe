Austrian Gay Twink With Tight Holo Webcam - More On Gaytube18.net. It's a nice lock screen but the I hate the look of that clock. Ideally I'd have a different clock there but if not I prefer to remove it altogether. Anyone know if that's possible? Can't find an option to disable it in settings.

At the Spa at Koloa Landing®, the natural landscape of Kauai is woven harmoniously with sophisticated modern design, creating the ideal oasis for unwinding after the day’s adventures. After my VZW Galaxy Nexus was upgraded to 4.2.2, I found the new clock on the lockscreen to be quite ugly. I downloaded Holo Locker from the Play Store to fix it. It's great, but the only problem is that it doesn't seem to have lockscreen controls for music. Does anyone know of any apps on the Play Store that can also restore the Ice Cream Sandwich look of the lockscreen but maintain the connection with Music Apps? Thanks. 
 I've been playing computer games for about 25 years, since my mother bought me an Amiga 500 for "school work". All I did, all day, every day, was play Dungeon Master. I'm 42 now, and I thought that sense of wonder, discovery and an all-consuming "what's around the corner" was gone from my old, jaded gaming life. But then, Subnautica. Holy crap balls. This game made me feel like a kid again, full of awe and excitement. 77 hours played. 2 full bases. 3 scanner bases. Fully customised Cyclops.

I just want a locker with the same ease of use, look and feel, and customizablility of launchers like Nova. The most customizable one is Widgetlocker, but it's out of date and fidgety if you're trying to make something simple and good looking. Right now, I use ACDisplay, which isn't customizable at all, and I can't use a custom wallpaper, but it looks nice, shows notifications (awesome) and unlocks anywhere (which I really love over sliding to unlock, or the fixed circle in HoloLocker). sick♡disgusting♡magical girl Listen Here. cover art: meganemeat on deviant art. Been trying to catch up on mahou shoujo site and menhera chan lately and it inspired me to make this playlist. 
I'm wondering if it is at all possible to put live wallpapers on my lock screen, whether it's through settings or an app of some sort. I tried ACDisplay, LockerMaster, and the free version of Holo Locker (though it seems the paid version just lets you change it to a static wallpaper?). Am I missing something, or is it just impossible? Thanks. Get pumped for the festival by checking out the stacked roster of artists. Just got a Samsung Galaxy S4 (ATampT). This isn't my first Android device, but I'm super hating the default lock screen (with the balloon). I thought this would be easy to replace with something like Holo Locker. Problem is that I can't get the security lock to work. I want a PIN, but what I'm getting instead is the Holo Locker (or really any other alternative lock screen) unlocking with no PIN to the default lock screen with the balloon, where I enter my PIN. Can't I enter the PIN native. So i have recently stumbled upon this subreddit and love it. I want to customize my phone with the quality iv seen in this subreddit. However I want to start out with my lock screen and slowly work my way to changing my home screen over. I have tried a few programs such as holo locker and magic locker however they make my phone lag and dont always pull up the lock screen when i hit the power button. And sometimes they make me unlock my phone multiple times to get to my home screen. I love CM9, from what I've seen, but I'm thinking of just putting in plain old ICS without HTC's little tweaks. I do like most of them, but I think the phone will look better and run more smoothly without sense 4.0 running all the time. I already have apps like holo locker and launcher to make it seem less like a sense phone, but it sometimes takes a full 4 seconds for my home screen to load. So, does anyone have advice? Should I flash the Rom? Would that even work? Or should After a lot of deliberation I purchased an HTC One this past Saturday afternoon from the local T-Mobile store. Along with the One, I had been considering Nexus 4 and the iPhone. I had come from a line of Nexus phones starting with the Nexus One, followed by the Galaxy Nexus. My decision to go with the One was based on positive reviews, reddit posts, and the ease of transitioning into this phone versus the iPhone (I have purchased apps, great google integration, etc.). After three

I want a PIN, but what I'm getting instead is the Holo Locker (or really any other alternative lock screen) unlocking to the default lock screen with the balloon, where I enter my PIN. Can't I enter the PIN natively with Holo Locker I was wondering if there is any app that can hide on screen buttons for a specific app. I have Holo Locker, and I feel like it would look better without the on screen buttons showing. I've tried widgetlocker and holo locker by mobint, but neither of them are quite right. We have a million stock android homescreen apps like nova launcher and holo launcher HD, so why not the lockscreen. I want a lockscreen like holo locker (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mobint.lockeramphl=en) but with the option of adding the DashClock widget and hopefully being able to slide to unlock from anywhere. I have a rooted HTC M8 and its default lock screen doesn't allow me to edit the widget. I have found Xposed modules that allow me to edit the widget, but then they make the rest of the lock screen behave differently. I have also found many lock screen replacements Most of us here will agree Google took a step back with the lockscreen of version 4.2 My question is, do you think most custom roms will have an option for the old 4.1 one? I hope ParanoidAndroid does, I was gonna use that with my Nexus 4 when I get one. Also, there's this app called Holo Locker whic emulates the lockscreen of 4.1. I've heard reports of it being laggy. It's also for pre-JB devices and I'm not certain is has all the features of the LS, like up for Google Now, left for camera Not liking the 4.3 update so far. 1. Is there anyway to change the vibrate pattern for new texts? The double vibrate on new text messages is making me crazy. 2. Is there anyway to make it so new text messages don't "cover up" the clock on the lock screen? 3. Did they really get rid of the feature to have short cuts with a security lock? I really don't like the idea of having no security on my phone but at the same time, the new lockscreens for pin or pattern have no usability (and hard reada. 
Hey everyone, thanks for clickin. So basically I'm running the custom rom paranoid android 3.99 on my Note 2 and i love it. Super light weight, everything runs very fast. Except for the lock screen. Its excruciatingly slow when the screen is totally off, i press a button to wake the screen and it can take anywhere from 2 seconds to like 7 or 8 before i see anything. Is there something i can do or change? I have even tried 3rd party lockers like holo locker, go locker, magic locker My camera took like 4 8 minute long videos of being held by me or being in my pocket. I have holo locker on, and I'm not running a custom Rom. Lookout says everything is OK. But what do you think. what is rooting and what are roms? ive seen people talk about these and post pictures of their custom UI and it looks really nice, and gets me interested. i just dont know how to go about doing that. right now im using a combination of holo locker and nova launcher, which im okay with. i still prefer the default sense launcher. im looking to just change a few things, and am wondering if there are any launchers i can use for this, or if ill be able to accomplish this through rooting It seems to me that it would make a lot of sense for holodecks to either have a physical and dedicated locker room attached to the entrance, or else have a default holographic "locker room program" running upon the user's initial entrance and exit. This would mean crew members wouldn't have to walk around the ship in their Sherlock Holmes outfit, or in their 18th century naval uniform, or whatever. The locker room would have costume replicators, private changing rooms, and some sonic showers. Hello I am currently using widgetlocker right now. Are there any other good lock screen replacements that I should try?? Thanks. 
I've had a Motorola Atrix for the past 2 years. It was great when I first got it, but now I'm missing all of these new features on ICS/JB. I want to keep it stock as the available ROMs aren't quite there yet. What's the cheapest option to get a new, unsubsidized (modern) phone these days? Nexus 4? Used Galaxy 2019 Hunaseminare.
